                    Governance risk compliance (GRC) is a method for managing and strategizing an organization's regulations regarding governance, financial or physical risk, and regulatory compliance. It aligns the IT aspects with business objectives and works to improve the efficiency of a company. There are GRC consultants and GRC analysts who provide an assessment of a business’s GRC, identify risks, analyze the data, develop policies to benefit the workplace, and consult on the best choice of action. Your duties may involve optimizing GRC systems, implementing tactics to lower risk, providing internal audits, assisting with cybersecurity, creating routine reports, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
