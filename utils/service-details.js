                Multi cloud is the use of two or more clouds from different cloud providers. This can be any mix of Infrastructure, Platform, or Software as a Service (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). For example, you may consume email as service from one vendor, customer relationship management (CRM) from another, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) from yet another. Multi-cloud platforms enable the end users with below benefits.
