                If an organization is keeping up with things such as backups, patches and security, then the odds of an IT disruption or another problem down the road will greatly decrease. Moreover, instead of following the traditional method of waiting for a major issue to rise and then fix, a business operating with a managed service focuses on the prevention of these issues before they disrupt employees, management and/or clients.

Critical infrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines and electricity transmission

                <br />
                Critical infrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines and electricity transmission, requires extremely reliable, real-time monitoring and control technology. Increasingly, the monitoring and control of critical networks is accomplished over fiber optic lines. Many of the more recent electrical transmission links extend over very long distances.

                TeccManage provides complete monitoring, management and optimization services for everything on your IT infrastructure that could result business disruption.

                <br />
                The generation of energy from renewable sources such as hydro, wind and solar often means that the generation of energy is separated over long distances from the areas of consumption. Repeaterless solution eliminates the need for optical regeneration of telemetry communication signals and saves costly capital and operational expenditures for the owners and operators of these critical infrastructures.
